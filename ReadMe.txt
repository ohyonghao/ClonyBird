Adopted from the YouTube tutorial on the YouTube channel quill18creates
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPXOQq7PWh5OdCwEO60Y8jQ.

Most of this was following along the tutorial, but quite a bit of the finishing
touches were to correct coding errors, and lack of standard due to the fast
pace nature of the coding session.
 
A lot of the pieces were also written ahead of time as ideas came to me during
the tutorial process and was not simply a listen and copy of the tutorial.  It
was always fun to get an idea, implement it, and then have the tutorial
continue in the same direction I had thought out.  Other pieces had to be
researched drawing largely on "Unity in Action" by Joseph Hocking to suplement
pieces and provide some guidance on organization and structure.
 
Notably:
* Pieces moved to Controllers rather than being sprewn about
* Added graphics for settings menu
* Synchronized settings to last between sessions
* Multiple levels of setting screens
* Points calculations and clock penalty
* Ceiling does not kill you
* Added my name to the list of authors for the changes that I made
